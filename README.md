I’m @MorganSchneider, a Ph.D. student in meteorology at the University of Oklahoma and an interdisciplinary researcher with some experience in electrical engineering topics as well. I am currently affiliated with the National Severe Storms Lab (NSSL)/Cooperative Institute for Severe and High-Impact Weather Research and Operations (CIWRO) as a graduate research assistant. I have previously been affiliated with the OU Advanced Radar Research Center.

I have been involved in research projects across a wide variety of topics:
  - Understanding processes influencing mesovortex dynamics and evolution in quasi-linear convective systems using idealized numerical simulations and observations. (Ph.D. dissertation)
  - Quantifying and mitigating debris centrifuging-induced bias in measured Doppler velocities from tornadoes using spectral processing techniques and fuzzy logic classification. (M.S. thesis)
  - Retrieving the 3-D geomagnetic field by assimilating observations of the equatorial electrojet with scalar satellite magnetic intensity measurements. (NOAA Hollings internship)
  - Using thermodynamic measurements from remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) to quantify turbulent intensity in the atmospheric boundary layer via structure functions. (Undergraduate research)

My primary languages are MATLAB and Python, and I am proficient in bash shell scripting and Git.
I am open to collaboration on research involving supercell/QLCS/tornado processes, radar processing and interpretation, and tornado debris studies.
