I am currently a postdoctoral associate at the Canadian Severe Storms Laboratory at Western University. I received my Ph.D. in meteorology at the University of Oklahoma in 2025.

I have been involved in research projects across a wide variety of topics:
  - Understanding processes influencing vortex dynamics and evolution in quasi-linear storms using idealized numerical simulations and observations.
  - Quantifying and mitigating debris centrifuging-induced bias in measured Doppler velocities from tornadoes using spectral processing techniques.
  - Retrieving the 3-D geomagnetic field by assimilating observations of the equatorial electrojet with scalar satellite magnetic intensity measurements.
  - Using thermodynamic measurements from remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) to quantify turbulent intensity in the atmospheric boundary layer via structure functions.

My primary languages are MATLAB and Python, and I am proficient in bash shell scripting and Git.
I am open to collaboration on research involving supercell/QLCS/tornado processes, radar processing and interpretation, and tornado debris studies.
